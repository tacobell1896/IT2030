# Chapter 2: How to develop a single-page MVC web app
This chapter will show how to develop a single-page .NET Core MVC web app that calculates the value of a series of investments.
## How to create a Core MVC web app
- create from .NET Core template
- add template
### How to add a controller
- right click controllers folder, add > controller
- select MVC controller - Empty
- Name controller
- method of controller is an action such as GET or POST
- ViewBag property is available in controllers and views, with dynamic properties to get and set values
- View() method returns a ViewResult object for the view associated with an action method
- deselect use a layout page
- contains both c# and HTML code
- uses server side code to embed c# within html
- declare a razor block by coding @{}
- declare a razor expression by @ and then expression
#### Example of cshtml view
```
    @{
        Layout = null;
    }
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
        <title>Home Page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Future Value Calculator</h1>
        <p>Customer Name: @ViewBag.Name</p>
        <p>Future Value: @ViewBag.FV.ToString("C2")</p>
    </body>
    </html>
```

## How to configure an MVC web app
- startup.cs file contains the code to configure the middleware for HTTP requests
- Configure() method begins by checking whether the web hosting environment is a development environment. it then configures the environment depending on if it is production or development environment
- UseEndpoints() method sets teh default controller for the app in the Home controller, and sets the default action of the Index() action.
#### Example Startup.cs file after edits
```
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
    using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

    namespace FutureValue
    {
        public class Startup
        {
            // Use this method to add services to the controller
            public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
            {
                services.AddControllersWithViews();
            }

            // Use this method to configure the HTTP request pipeline
            public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
            {
                app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
                app.UseHttpsRedirection();
                app.UseStaticFiles();

                app.UseRouting();
                app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
                {
                    endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
                        name: "default",
                        pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
                });
            }
        }
    }
```

## How to run a web app and fix errors
- to run the app in default browser without debugging, Ctrl+F5
- to stop, close the browser
- to change browser, select from the browser drop down menu
- Visual studio by default runs in IIS Express. To change, select the project's name from the drop down
- Kestrel server uses a cmd line window. To exit, close the cmd line window.
- F5 starts the app with debugging on

## How to work with a model
- a model is a c# class that models the data for the app. Typically stored in the models folder
- a model can't have the same name as a namespace
### FutureValueModel class with three properties and a method
```
    namespace FutureValue.Models
    {
        public class FutureValueModel
        {

            public decimal MonthlyInvestment { get; set; }
            public decimal YearlyInterestRate { get; set; }
            public int Years { get; set; }
            public decimal CalculateFutureValue() 
            {
                int months = Years * 12;
                decimal monthlyInterestRate = YearlyInterest Rate / 12 / 100;
                decimal futureValue = 0;
                for (int i=0; i<months; i++)
                {
                    futureValue = (futureValue + MonthlyInvestment) *
                                    (1 + monthlyInterestRate);
                }
                return futureValue;
            }
        }
    }
```

## Razor view imports page
### Makes it easier to work with:
- Model classes
- tag helpers
- makes it easier to work with model classes and the tag helpers that are available from .NET Core MVC
