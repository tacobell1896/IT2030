## An introduction to web apps
---
- web app - consists of a set of web pages that are generated by user requests
---
- Web apps consist of clients and a web server
- Clients often access web pages via a web browser. Web server stores all the files that generate the pages of a web app
- network connects the clients to the web server
- to request a page from a web server, the user types in the address of a web page into the web browser
- URL consists of protocol, domain name, path, and filename. HTTPS is assumed in most cases
- LAN connects computers that are near each other.
- WAN consists of two or more LANs
- cloud refers to software and services that run on the internet
- ISP owns a WAN connected to the Internet

## How static web pages are processed
- HTML: used to define the pages of a web app
- static web page: built from HTML file
- when web page is requested, browser sends an HTTP request to the server that includes the name of the file that is being requested
 - when server receives request, it sends back the requested files as part of an HTTP response
 - browser then renders the response into a web page that is displayed to the user
 ---
 ## How dynamic web pages are processed
 - dynamic web page is a web page generated by a program running on a web server
 - when a request is received for a dynamic web page, the web server looks for the appropriate application server in order to properly process the file
 - typically data from a database is requested
 - once the data is finished processing, the html, css, and javascript is returned to the web server, and then sent to the user via a HTTP response
 - round trip: describes the process in which the above occurs
 - Kestrel: cross platform web server that functions as app server for .NET Core
 - IIS: Windows only app server for ASP.NET apps
 - SQL Server: database server for .NET Core and .NET apps

 ## An intro to the MVC pattern
 ### Components
 - model: consists of the code that provides data access and the business logic
 - view: code that makes up the user interface shown to the end user
 - controller: code that receives requests from users, gets appropriate data, and stores in model,
 ### Benefits
 - makes it easier to split workloads across teams
 - makes it possible for automated testing of individual components
 - makes it possible to swap components
 - app is easier to maintain
 ### Drawbacks
 - more work to set up

 ## An introduction to .NET Core MVC
 ### 3 Models for web apps in .NET
 1. ASP.NET Web Forms
- Released in 2002
- provides rapid app development by letting devs build pages similar to Windows Forms
- problems include poor performance, improper separation of concerns, lack of support for automated testing, and limited control over front end returned to the browser
- Uses .NET framework, proprietary to the Windows Operating System
 2. ASP.NET MVC
- Released in 2007
- uses MVC pattern that is used by other web dev platforms
- fixes many issues to provide better performance, separation of concerns, support for automated testing, and better control of front end
- still proprietary to Windows
 3. ASP.NET Core MVC
- released in 2015
- uses a service to implement MVC pattern that is used by other web dev platforms
- provides all functionality of MVC with better performance, more modularity, and cleaner code
- built on .NET Core, which is multi platform and can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Some web components of .NET and .NET Core
- .NET Framework
- .NET Core
- ASP.NET Web Forms use services of the .NET Framework
- .NET MVC work by using services of the .NET Framework
- .NET Core MVC use services of .NET Core
