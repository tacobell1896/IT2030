## How static web pages are processed
- HTML: used to define the pages of a web app
- static web page: built from HTML file
- when web page is requested, browser sends an HTTP request to the server that includes the name of the file that is being requested
 - when server receives request, it sends back the requested files as part of an HTTP response
 - browser then renders the response into a web page that is displayed to the user
